# Drowsiness-Detection-System
The objective of this project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

## Concepts Used:
Computer Vision

Programming Language:Python

## Haar Cascade Classifier:
I have used pre-trained haar cascade classifier for identifying face of the driver, right and left eye.

Haar Cascade Classifier is cascade based classifier which uses ensemble learning(Adaboost) to detect features. Each cascade is responsible for detecting particular feature in frame or image(eye,nose etc.)
